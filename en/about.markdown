Hello Dreamer,

I am a curious wanderer who tells stories by the fire at night. I like collecting shiny things like magpies. My nickname is *takatukacı* since my childhood. And this is my nest where I collect those shiny and magical *takatuka*s[^typeface].

**What does Takatukaci means?**

Although “takatuka” has another meaning in Turkish dictionaries, in colloquial language it means timeworn, shabby objects or rumpus. Likewise when I was 6, the husband of my aunt used to call me as “takatukacı” which means the one who collects “takatuka”, since I used to collect what I thought was beautiful even if it was shabby, and sometimes I made a mess while carrying them altogether from place to place.

If you have other magical, mythological, magnificent, natural / supernatural and unforgettable beings that you know, or listen from your grandpa, or believe in your family, or come across in a book / movie, please write to me at **<span class="envelope"><noscript>turn on Javascript to see my e-mail address</noscript></span>**.
