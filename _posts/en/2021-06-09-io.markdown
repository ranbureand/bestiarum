In Greek Mythology, Io is a very beautiful girl and daughter of Inachus, the God of River. She was a priestess of the Goddess Hera. Could being a priestess in his wife’s temple keep Zeus’s satyriasis away? I don’t think so and it could not.

Zeus fell in love with Io as the other 1278686. women in his life.  However, Hera saw through his husband and decided to punish Io. Zeus converted Io to a white heifer  -as like there is no other animal left in the world-.

To exact her revenge, Hera sent a gadfly to sting Io continuously, driving her to wander the world without rest.

She first crossed the Ionian Sea (now you know where the name Ioanian comes from) then she reached the Bosporus, now known as the Strait of Istanbul, which continental boundary between Europe and Asia and connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara.

Finally, Io arrived in Egypt and met Zeus there. Zeus converted her back to her human form and in return, Io made many kids for him.

In some resources, Io was identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis.
