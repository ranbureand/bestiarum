The Grootslang is a legendary cryptid which was created as a mistake by the Gods. The gods were new to the art of creating life and they didn’t yet understand the dangers of making something as powerful as Grootslang that could coil its body around any creature and crush the life out of it in seconds.

They tried to correct it and tried to exterminate every Grootslang that lived. They split the powers of the Grootslang across two species: the elephant and the snake. But one Grootslang managed to escape and became the mother of a whole species of mythological creatures.

Today, the best-known Grootslang, it’s said, hides in a cave in Richtersveld, South Africa. There it lies in wait for anyone foolish enough to stumble onto its domain and passes the time by luring in elephants, crushing them, and swallowing them whole.

While searching for treasure in Richtersveld in 1917, English businessman Peter Grayson disappeared after members of his party were attacked and injured by lions revived the belief that the Grootslang is still alive.
