It is a huge red-colored bird with supernatural qualities in Turkish mythology. Symbolizes immortality and resurrection. It is reborn every day. It is also available under different names in the mythologies of the nations of the world. 

However, the most important difference of this bird in Turkish mythology from its counterparts in other mythologies is that it is not alone but has a similar or even a twin. The Konrul Bird is mentioned together with the Tuğrul Bird. Both embody all the qualities of the Phoenix.

Tuğrul Bird can also go underground. According to a legend, the Tuğrul Bird represents the Mongols and the Konrul Bird represents the Turks. He lives in the darkness behind the mountain kaf in the endless sea beyond the horizon line.
