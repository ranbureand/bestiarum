Coyolxāuhqui  [kojoɬˈʃaːʍkʷi] is the Moon Goddess in Aztec Mythology. However, she was killed, dismembered, and decapitated by her brother Huitzilopochtli [wiːt͡siloːˈpoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi] who is the God of War.

One day Coatlicue [/kwɑːtˈliːkweɪ/], while the mother of all gods, was sweeping the porch of her shrine on the summit of the Serpent Mountain, a ball of hummingbird feathers fell from the sky. Coatlicue took the ball of feathers and placed them in her apron. Then, miraculously, she became pregnant with Huitzilopochtli.

Coyolxāuhqui, the eldest daughter, who was not convinced about the miraculous pregnancy story, gathered the other 400 brothers under her command and prepared for the battle against their mother.

Meanwhile, hearing of the attack, the pregnant Coatlicue miraculously gave birth to a fully grown and armed Huitzilopochtli who sprang from her womb. Huitzilopochtli fought against his sister to protect his mother and won.

He decapitated his sister and threw her body from the Serpent Mountain. Rolling down the mountain, Coyolxāuhqui's lifeless body got separated from her arms and legs. This brutal killing was also described in the Coyolxāuhqui Disc found in Mexico in 1978.

Huitzilopochtli threw his sister's head into the sky to give some relief to his mother, who was devastated by this war, and the head became the Moon. So her mother could see her daughter's face every night. 400 brothers also became the southern 400 stars.
