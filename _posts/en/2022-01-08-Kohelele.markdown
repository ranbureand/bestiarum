What super power would you like to have? How far can your imagination go? Nope, do not copy from Marvel. I have a suggestion for you that will push the limits of your imagination: What about a Flying Vagina as a super power?!

Kohe Lele is mentioned in Hawaiian Mythology and means "Flying Vagina".

Kapo, the goddess of fertility, sensed that her sister Pele, the Goddess of Fire, is in danger. Pele is about to be raped by Kamapua'a, a god half-human and half-pig. Kapo detached out her vagina and tossed it like a boomerang into the direction of Kamapua'a.

A flying vagina (Kohe Lele) floating in the sky with its wings distracted Kamapua’a and lured him to the Oahu Island.

Kohe Lele crashed to the ground and turned into a giant crater that swallowed Kamapua’a in. Thus, Kapo saved her sister Pele. Kohe Lele returned to Kapo after trapping the rapist Kamapua'a on the ground, inside the crater.
