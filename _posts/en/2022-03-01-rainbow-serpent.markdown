The Giant Rainbow Serpent wanted to emerge from the darkness below the ground. He was so powerful that as he pushed the ground and created mountains, hills, and valleys. He brought life to the earth out of the water. The color blue on his back brought winter, red for summer, yellow for spring and orange brought autumn.

The Rainbow Serpent is still with us. Sometimes he moves from one well to another. That is when the rainbow appears in the sky as the trace of him.

The Rainbow Serpent is the first ancestral spirit or god in the creation story of the Aborigines culture of 50,000 years. It is depicted as a colorful giant snake. In Aboriginal culture, he is the creator of all life and, in his anger, the destroyer. Although its shape and name vary within the Continent of Australia, it is always associated with water or rain.

It is one of the most well-known stories of the Aborigines, and the belief in this sacred snake still continues. But the word “dreamtime” or “dreaming”, which is translated from the Aboriginal language into English, to explain the concept of time in these stories is even more magical to me.
Dreaming is when the first spirits/gods come to earth like the Rainbow Serpent and begin to create life. These spirits did not create life and left the earth, so creation still continues, and "dream" evolves into reality at every moment.

Therefore, the time of Dreaming is neither past nor future nor present. Every now and never. “Dreaming” is also about the place, as the first souls transform themselves into trees, stars, wells, and stones once they created the world.

So, whatever reality we see around us was a dream once upon a time. After all, isn't the universe "God's dream"?
