If you ever go to Scotland, I highly recommend you to go during the summer months. Otherwise, you might run into Nuckelavee. And the last thing you see might be his not-so-friendly red eyes.

The Nuckelavee is an underwater creature originally from Northern Scotland that lives in the ocean during the summer. So no one knows what it looks like when it's in the water. But when the summer ends, it comes ashore, and turns into one of the most malevolent creatures, as the Scots call it.

He is a creature whose lower body is integrated with the horse he is riding, does not have skin, and his arms reach the ground. It brings disease with its poisonous breath and kills all crops and animals. (and people of course) He also causes droughts and water shortages.

But when the summer months come and Mither, the spirit of all seas and oceans, returns, he traps Nuckelavee back in the ocean waters. And there it will be imprisoned until the summer ends.

Nuckelavee can't hurt either when it rains because it's afraid of freshwater. Therefore, jumping into a river or lake for protection may be a solution when you encounter Nuckelavee. Of course, there is no guarantee.
