Curupira is a forest demon with orange-red hair and green skin in Brazilian folklore. It lives in the forests of Brazil and is the protector of flora and fauna. The most terrible aspect of this demon is that its feet are reversed, like the ones in the jinn stories told us in childhood.

Curupira uses its backward feet to create footprints that lead to its starting point, to confuse hunters and travelers who threaten to harm the environment. Based on the scale of the harm they cause, he punishes, curses or kills them. Curupira frightens or drives her victims insane by creating illusions and making a loud whistle-like sound.

One of Curupira's favorite punishments (also my favorite) is to transform the hunter into a hunt. For example, you caught an animal in one of the Brazilian forests and - let's say you're a psychopat - you decided to torture the animal. Curupira transforms you into that animal, and the animal into a hunter..

Curupira is a true green lover and friendly to those who do not intend to harm the forest. It helps those who need help or are lost. However some legends say that he kidnaps the children to play and live in the forest.

Tobacco and a type of rum called cacha√ßa are Curupira's favorites.When entering the forest, locals often present them as gifts to protect themselves from the wrath of Curupira.
