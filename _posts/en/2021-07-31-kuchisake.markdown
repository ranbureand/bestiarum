“According to the local newsletter of Gifu, in a late winter night of 1978, H.S. (17) met a woman with a mask on the street. The young woman stopped H.S. and asked, "Am I pretty?". Surprised by this event, H.S. wanted to continue on his way by telling the woman that she was beautiful.
 
But the young woman did not allow him to pass and she took off the mask covering his face and asked again, "Am I beautiful?" H.S. didn't know what to say because he was out of his mind with fear. Her mouth was slitted across her cheeks from ear to ear. H.S. was disgusted with her too. The young woman went mad, injured H.S. to death with 12 knife strokes and disappeared.

H.S. was brought to the hospital quickly with the help of the surrounding citizens, he is still in the hospital and has the risk of death”. Ok, this is a fake news, partially at least. But this incident, which took place in Japan in 1970’s and even caused the closure of schools, is true. At least according to the locals of Gifu.

Kuchisake Onna (Japanese: slit mouthed woman), is a myth in far-east countries, who is generally said to attack kids returning home from school. She wears red clothes, her eyes are like a fox and her voice is like a cat.

There are many different stories about how the Kuchisake Onna myth came about. It is said that women dressed in frightening disguises like this to avoid the dangers of traveling at night became an urban legend over time. Or it is believed that she is a lunatic who escaped from a mental institution in Gifu, Japan in the 1970s.

In the 1990s, as awry results of wrong plastic surgery started to increase, the rumors of Kuchisake Onna started to spread again. It is believed that she is a women who went crazy because of the  wrong plastic surgery. In addition to many ways, this belief brought another way of protection against Kuchisake Onna: Hair pomade.

Because the doctor who performed the plastic surgery put so much pomade on his hair, Kuchisake Onna hated this smell. And every time she thought of it, she went crazy. Therefore, if you shout “Pomade” 3 times in a row when you meet her, she will immidiately run away with no harm. Other methods are to throw a jar of pomade on her head, or you can write pomade on your palm and show it to her.
