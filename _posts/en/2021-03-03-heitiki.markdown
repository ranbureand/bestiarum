The hei tiki is a small personal adornment, carved by hand, and is worn around the neck mostly in Polynasia. Hei Tiki has a humanoid appearance with its enlarged head (about one-third the size of the figure) and prominent eyes. (It is a little bit creepy too.)

It has been suggested that during funerals and times of grief, the hei tiki was used as a surrogate for the deceased when the body could not be recovered, and it was placed on the ground, sung to, and wept over.

When a person of status died, such as a chieftain, the hei tiki was buried with the body and recovered at a later time when it was believed to have increased mana and special value.
At the same time, it is also used as a bridge to deceased ancestors and connects the past, present, and future.

The hei tiki was also used as a protective talisman as well as by women during pregnancy and to encourage easy childbirth. The enlarged head of the tiki shape and contortion of limbs suggests the tiki is a human embryo and possibly that of an unborn child (a particularly powerful spirit).
