Bakezori is a traditional Japanese sandal-shaped 'yokai' that comes to life at night and spook inhabited households during the night. It has two arms, two legs, and only one eye. It runs around the house and continuously chants “Kararin,kororin, kankororin! Two eyes, three eyes, two teeth!”.

He sings a rhyme to mock the other ‘ordinary’ sandals: ‘the three eyes’ refers to the three holes where the sandal straps are attached and "teeth two" refers to the two wooden platforms underneath the sandals.
