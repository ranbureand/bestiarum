Illuyanka is the giant sea serpent / dragon mentioned in Hittite Mythology. When he defeats Teshup, the god of storm and sky of the Hittites, he takes his heart and eyes. Based on a prophecy Teshup learned, he marries the daughter of a poor man To avenge himself upon the dragon Illuyanka.

Teshup has a so who soon grows up (it is not known whether his father was forced or not), he marries Illuyanka's daughter. Teshup asks his son Sarruma to bring back his heart and eyes when he goes to his wife's house. Sarruma, who is unaware of the grudges between Illuyanka and Teshup, does what his father says.

Teshup, who took his heart and eyes back, gets fully charged and, confronts Illuyanka again and this time he kills it. Meanwhile Sarruma realizes that he had been used for this purpose. He demands his father tor kill him along with the dragon’s and shouts “Kill me too” and his father kills him too.(at least a little bit of a hesitation would have been nice!)

This legend of the Hittites is closely related to the fight between Horus and Seth in Egyptian Mythology that resulted in the loss of Horus' eyes and the legend of the murder of Tiamat of the Babylonians. If you want to look even further, you can take a look at the similar battle between Thor and the giant sea serpent Jörmungandr in Norse Mythology.
