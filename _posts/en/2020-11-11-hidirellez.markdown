Hıdrellez is one of the oldest spring festivals. The night between the 5th and 6th of May is accepted as the end of the winter-the beginning of summer and is celebrated with ceremonies. Hıdrellez is the combination of the names of two immortal prophets: Khidr & Elijah (Orig. Hızır & Ilyas). And it is believed that they come together every year on that day. Hızır is the protector and helper of those who live on the land whereas Elijah comes to the rescue of those who have difficulty in the sea. (Yeah kind of like a superhero). In other words, Khidr is earth, Elijah is water. On the night of Hıdrellez, water meets the soil and brings abundance to it.

Hıdrellez is known as "Hıdrellez" in Anatolia, "Ederlez, Edirlez, Herdeljez, Hıdırles" in Macedonia and the Balkans. In Bulgaria and Serbia, it is celebrated on the same day as the St. George Festival.
It was believed that the wishes made that night would come true, and abundance would come to the houses if the required rituals are done. At the same time, you should believe that your wish will come true otherwise it won’t.

Wishes should be written or drawn on a piece of paper, or -even better- a small model of the wish is made and buried at the root of a rose sapling that night. In some places it is hung on a tree. It is believed that Khidr will pass through here during his visit to the earth and make the wishes come true.
Houses are cleaned before Hıdrellez night and everyone wears new or clean clothes that day. Meals are eaten collectively or as a family. Every region has its own dish to cook on that day. And dessert must be served at dinner.

Also, jumping over the fire that night repels evilness. It is also believed that all troubles and sorrows are poured into the fire.
On that day everyone plays on the swings for redemption.
Although Hıdrellez seems like a rural tradition, it is a festival which is celebrated also in big cities with its colorful entertainments and ceremonies.
