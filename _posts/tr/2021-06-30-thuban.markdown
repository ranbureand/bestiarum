Did you know that the pole star (originally called Polaris) is not always the same star? The pole star, pointing to the north of the earth and standing still in the sky, is actually not that stable. About 3800 years ago, the pole star was not the current Polaris star, but Thuban, a.k.a Alpha Draconis, in the Draco Constellation.

Thuban is not one of the brightest stars. What makes Thuban important is that it is directly connected to the Great Pyramid in Giza.

The Great Pyramid, the most important and mysterious one, was built c. BC. 2500: when Thuban was the pole star and it was at its closest distance to the earth axis. The air shafts opening to the King's Chamber, the most important chamber of the pyramid, face the Orion Belt in the South and the Thuban Star in the North.

Although the mystery of these air shafts is not completely solved, it is believed that when the king's soul ascends to the sky, it will go towards these stars, which were considered to be the two most important stars.
A short note: There are 14 different pole stars in total, and the star closest to the 0 point to the earth axis sits on the throne as the pole star for a period. Over about 26,000 years, Earth wobbles around in a complete circle.

The well-known Mayan calendar, which was believed 21/12/2012 would be the doomsday, follows this cycle. 21st of December was not the end of the world, but the end of this 26,000-year cycle and the beginning of a new cycle.

Polaris, today's pole star, will remain as our pole star for about 3000 years more and will leave its throne to Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation.
