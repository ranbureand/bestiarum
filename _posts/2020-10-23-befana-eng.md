Befana is a old witch who visits all the children of Italy on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany (The night between the 5th and 6th of January) to fill their socks with candy and presents if they are good, while leaving bad kids empty-handed and sadly staring at a lump of coal. In some parts of Italy a stick or straw in a stocking was placed instead of coal. Being a good housekeeper, many say she will sweep the floor before she leaves. To some the sweeping meant the sweeping away of the problems of the year. The child's family typically leaves a small glass of wine and a plate with a few morsels of food, often regional or local, for the Befana (familiar right?:).

The reason why it is celebrated on this date actually is originated from an ancient tradition. It is believed that the twelve days after the solstice are the most important days of the year and in the period between the 25th of December (which was traditionally the winter solstice and the day of Sol Invictus in Roman Empire) and the 6th of January a few miracles take place.

Roman tradition, between the end of December and 6 January the goddess Diana flew over the fields to make them fertile. Also the goddess bore gifts of fruit or sweets to children, and this seems very much like the Christian tradition and to that of Befana.

Throughout the Veneto they light bonfires where they burn a straw puppet of befana representing ‘the old’, i.e. the old year, while savoring local mulled wine. In some regions a legend has it that on this night the animals start talking, telling stories and making prophecies and, for this, the farmers sleep next to them.
